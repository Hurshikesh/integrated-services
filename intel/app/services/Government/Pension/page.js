              Gratuity is a statutory benefit payable to the employees by the companies. It is calculated as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. For companies, it is an open-ended liability and is calculated from the date of joining. The annual increase in the liability on gratuity increases for the company as the additional past service gratuity will increase with increased salary.
              For employers, it is important & imperative to consider the impact of this on their annual liability and make provisions in the book of accounts in the P&L Account, failing which, the liability and the profits might be understated or overstated and also, the provisions of Accounting Standards may not be compiled.

              Employee Provident Fund is a defined contribution scheme, wherein, there's an equal contribution of a fixed sum to the Employee Provident Fund Organization from both, the employer and the employee. In case the provident funds have exempt status, the employer is responsible for the provision of benefits and must ensure that the fund earns at least equivalent to EPFO rate or more.
