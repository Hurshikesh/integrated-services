      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mb-4">What is EPF?</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The Employee Provident Fund or the EPF is a retirement benefits scheme for salaried employees in the private sector. The Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) manages the EPF. Any organisation or firm with 20 or more employees gets covered under the EPFO. The Employees Provident Fund Organisation operates three schemes.It is compulsory for all employees who draw a basic salary of less than Rs 15,000 per month to become members of the EPF. You cannot opt-out of the EPF scheme once you become a scheme member. An employee can make an enhanced contribution up to a maximum of 100% of the basic salary to the voluntary provident fund. The employer will not match the contributi
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mb-4">Formula to Calculate EPF Amount</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          To understand how to calculate EPF, let us have an example.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Employee basic salary + dearness allowance = Rs 14,000 <br/>
          Employee contribution towards the EPF = 12% * 14,000 = Rs 1,680 <br/>
          Employer contribution towards the EPF = 3.67% * 14,000 = Rs 514 <br/>
          Employer contribution towards EPS = 8.33% * 14,000 = Rs 1,166. <br/>
          The total contribution by the employer and employee towards the EPF account of the employee = Rs 1,680 + Rs 514 = Rs 2,194. <br/>
          Now with the applicable interest rate of 8.25% p.a, the monthly earned interest will be; 8.25%/12 = 0.679% <br/>
          Assuming the employee joined the Firm XYZ in April 2019. The total EPF contribution for April will be Rs 2,194. The EPF scheme will not pay any interest for April. <br/>
          The total amount in EPF account May 2019 = Rs 4,388 (Rs 2,194 + Rs 2,194). <br/>
          He receives an interest of Rs 4,388 * 0.679% = Rs 29.79. <br/>
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The calculation will be continued until the retirement age (60) of the employee. The calculator will show the PF final amount.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600 mb-4">What must you know about EPF contributions?</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>Employee and Employer Contributions:</strong> EPF contributions are not taken only from your salary. Your employer is also bound to make equal contributions to your EPF account every month.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>Link Aadhaar and Bank Account:</strong> Employees must link the Aadhaar number and the bank account with the UAN.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>Nomination:</strong> You can nominate anyone for your EPF account. In case of the account holderâ€™s demise, the nominee will receive the account balance. You can change the nominee by submitting Form 2 to your companyâ€™s finance department or the EPFO department.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>Employee Pension Scheme (EPS):</strong> About 8.33% of your employerâ€™s monthly contribution (up to Rs 1,250) will be redirected to the EPS. This will help you get a monthly pension once you retire and fulfil certain conditions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>Withdrawals:</strong> If you decide to quit your job and withdraw the balance from your EPF account once and for all, you will only be able to remove a portion of the amount based on the purpose of withdrawal. Some valid reasons are unemployment, retirement, purchase of land, purchase/construction of a house, renovating a house, wedding, education, repaying a home loan, and medical reasons.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>Continuous Employment:</strong> If you are a retired person and have had continuous employment for the last 10 years, you can withdraw 100% of the EPS account balance. In case, you donâ€™t have continuous employment for the last 10 years, you can only withdraw money from the EPS account, according to the slabs based on your previous drawn salary as mentioned in the Table â€˜Dâ€™ below:

          Irrespective of the last drawn salary, the maximum salary considered for this calculation is Rs 15,000. Therefore, if your last drawn salary is Rs 42,000 and you have worked for eight consecutive years, the EPS amount you can withdraw is Rs 15,000 * 8.22 = Rs 1,23,300.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>Account Continuity:</strong> You donâ€™t have to withdraw the EPF contributions or close the account when you switch jobs. Just provide your UAN to the new employer. The new PF number created by your new employer will still be under your existing UAN. You must manually transfer the PF account balance from your previous employer to the PF account created by your new employer by filling Form 13. Alternatively, you can fill Form 11 to transfer the PF contributions to the new account automatically.
